## Summary
After reading the results we can conclude that most of the market shared goes for the annual suscribers which means that the life time value of the customers is good for sales.
Also, the male gender is the greatest market for this business, so it could be a good idea to start creating special products for them as a strategy to get into the market. 
We know that the days with greatest number of bike trips are Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday so maybe those days the customers could suffer of bike shortage and there we could satisfy the market.
